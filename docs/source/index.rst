Internals
=========

Reading the ``.py`` from the `forge <https://github.com/PythonJS/PythonJS>`_ might give you a head start about how it works but without a good understanding of how `ast module <http://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html>`_ works it will be difficult to understand all the magic. Is it useful ?
No. You don't need to understand how it works to use it. You might want to know what Python is converted to what Javascript to understand the errors that may arise and circuvent them and also you might learn something about Python or Javascript or both and contribute to PythonJS.
